## To-do List and Meta
Collaboration between Zone01 and The Sandbox. We had the opportunity to learn about Web3 technology.
To dip our toes in the water we had to create a To-Do List with ReactJS and link it to a smart contract using Solidity.

The potential user needs to connect to their MetaMask account every time they need to use the to-do list (adding/removing a task, check the task box).

A nice, simple exercice to comprehend the link between web3 and JS.
